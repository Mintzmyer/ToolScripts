# This script implements an idea by Oddmund Str√∏mmer, 
#     and popularized by Kent Beck, described here:
#     https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864
#     which I first heard about on HanselMinutes podcast here:
#     https://player.fm/series/hanselminutes-fresh-talk-and-tech-for-developers/test-commit-revert-with-kent-beck
#
# 'Test && Commit || Revert' is a workflow that seeks to 1up "Limbo On The Cheap"s
#     'Test && Commit' by strongly encouraging programmers to make as small,
#     incremental changes as possible...because if their tests fail their changes
#     are reverted and lost! This reduces Sunk Cost Fallacy waste.
#
# This script's intention is to make a generic impelementation of the workflow
#     so that it's all ready to experiment with when I have the opportune project

    # code currently fails but needs to pass...should tests and code
    # be co-developed, or should tests be written and then code added
    # to pass the new tests? Trying the latter, for now:
    echo "Revert!"
