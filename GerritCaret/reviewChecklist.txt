Commit message references requirements and testing note
Code contains unit tests, logging, and switch/flag for verbose debug stmts
Everything compiles and all tests pass, including no BIT errors (Update BIT)
Function blocks are commented, with additional comments where needed
Replace all Magic Numbers with named constants
Code is broken into functions by logic functionality, and not repeated
Functionality common to multiple programs is wrapped into a library
Check inputs for validity, pay attention to uninitialized values and null pointers
Exception handling should do something useful/appropriate, not just ignore it
Check logic errors on control flow, and terminal conditions are sensible
Avoid while(1) loops unless in a daemon/service, be mindful of busy-waiting/spinlocks
Consider environment and context; network status, SDI/HDMI inputs, ARINC data, etc
